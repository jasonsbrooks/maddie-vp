		<p>Hey Yalies!</p>
		<p>My name is Maddie and I’m thrilled at the prospect of serving as your vice president for the 2015-2016 school year. When I first came to Yale, I wasn't sure how exactly I wanted to get involved in student life. After joining YCC my Freshman Year as the representative to Calhoun, I realized that I absolutely loved being able to represent the student body and take part in policy discussions that have the potential for meaningful impact. Since then, I have been able to explore student government in many roles.</p>
		<p>This past year I served as the University Services Director of the Executive Board. This position has given me experience in coordinating projects as well as interacting with administrators. I desire to build off this strong foundation to be Vice President. I want to continue the discussions I have started with you, the student body. For example, this year I have served as a member of Mental Health and Counseling Student Advisory Committee. Through my work and exposure to the many issues and dialogue surrounding this topic, I am confident I will be able to continue to advocate for the needs of students. I seek to extend this advocacy to all spectrums of the student experience; from dining to career services to campus culture, I promise I will devote all my energy into making my Yale your Yale.</p>
		<p>So please, approach me with ideas, complaints, concerns, and questions. I am happy to talk about anything and everything. I hope you will vote for me for Vice President and join me in making our bright college years even brighter!</p>
		<p>Best,</p>
		<p>Maddie</p>

		<h2 class="platform-point">1. Student Life</h1>
		<div class="platform-section">
			<h3>Athletics</h3>
			<p>Athletics are an essential part of the Yale culture and student athletes are invested in their sports. However, I feel there is often a lack of enthusiasm about games and understanding of the issues that student athletes confront on a daily basis. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work with the Whaling Crew to promote games and increase publicity of important athletic events.</li> 
				<li>Make tickets for the Harvard Yale football game and for other important games available in the residential college.</li> 
				<li>Create student athlete focus group and work with Student Athlete Advisory Committee find name to communicate concerns of athletes to administration.</li> 
				<li>Implement project to ensure that the shuttles to and from the athletic fields are timely and well-coordinated.</li>
				<li>Conduct review of Yale Club Sports to ensure they are given enough money and that the fields and other resources are in good condition.</li>
			</ul>
			

			<h3>Greek Life</h3>
			<p>Greek life has a significant presence on the Yale campus yet there has emerged a lack of communication between the administration and the different fraternities and sororities on key issues.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establish a subcommittee on Greek life with leaders and members of various fraternities and sororities. This subcommittee would clear up misperceptions and look into the possibility of adding new fraternities or sororities, target perceptions of Greek life on campus, and communicate the concerns of students involved to the administration to combat the lack of communication that exists.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Intramural Sports</h3>
			<p>I am committed to the idea that all levels of athletics should have access to resources and every student should have the ability to participate in sports. I would like to see a YCC partnership with intramural sports. This past semester I helped work on a project to improve the condition of the intramural fields. This led to a conversation between representatives about how game times should be publicized and streamlined into an app.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create Intramural application on phone. This would list game times by college, display rankings, and show locations. It would be an easy way to access intramural sports when students are on the go and it would create more attendance and excitement for IMs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Cultural Houses</h3>
			<p>The cultural houses are a integral part of our student culture. They add vibrancy to the diversity of our campus. Thus, it is important that YCC communicate with the leaders of the cultural houses.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase funding for cultural houses.</li>
				<li>Communicate concerns of cultural house leaders to the administration.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Sustainability</h3>
			<p>As Vice President, I will be in talks with many student organizations who are vocal about divestment. I seek to continue the energy that came from YCC when we held the referendum last year and make sure that all student voices are being heard.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>University divestment from fossil fuels.</li>
				<li>Establish green appliances and technology in the new residential colleges.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2 class="platform-point">2. University Services</h2>
		<div class="platform-section">

			<p>As University Services Director this past year on the Executive Board, I have had the opportunity to work on many different projects under this domain. From things as complicated to Mental Health to as simple as getting phone chargers in Bass, I am dedicated to ensure the availability of resources to all students.</p>

			<h3>Transportation</h3>
			<p>Although we have great resources for transportation, there seems to be a lack of reliability with the shuttle and pick up services. Although this year we have started looking into improving the services through development of an application to track the shuttles, there is still much to be done.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement airport shuttle service with Yale coordinated buses taking students to the airport on the first and last days of break. This would be affordable and subsidized in order to lessen the costs that many students are forced to pay for cabs.</li>
				<li>Complete review of existing transportation services to determine whether it is necessary to hire more shuttles or drivers to keep up with the student demand, especially as it increases with more students coming in from the new residential colleges.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Dining</h3>
			<p>Over the course of this year, I have attended multiple YCC meetings with the top heads of Yale dining. I believe this working relationship that has been established will be critical in carrying out reforms this next year.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establish a student committee to give feedback. This committee would give honest feedback and suggestions about the ways that Yale dining can improve and would give administrators the opportunity to run new recipes to get student feedback.</p>
				<li>Increase gluten free and vegan options. Although options currently exist, students with gluten allergies and other specific dietary needs feel there on a given night there are sometimes no options for them to eat.</li>
				<li>Complete an evaluation of family night. Every college has different policies for family night which sometimes leads students to the colleges that are not strict in letting students from other colleges into their dining hall to eat. How can students be encouraged to stick to dining in their college? Should family night be mandatory</li>
				<li>Bag breakfasts in the dining halls. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and many students are on the 21 meal plan which includes breakfast. However, in a hurry to get to class, many students end up skipping breakfast yet still paying for the meal swipe. There should be a way to ensure that students get access to the breakfast they paid for even as they are on the go.</li>
				<li>Get a 24-hour coffee shop on campus. When all the libraries are closed and all the coffee shops around campus are closed the night owls don’t have many casual environments to study in other than a dorm room or college library. Think Bass Cafe for the nighttime.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>Mental Health</h3>
			<p>My experiences and involvement in Mental Health has been a integral part of my YCC experience. This past year I served on the Mental Health and Counseling Student Advisory Committee. I have been able to learn a lot through speaking with students and administrators who have been directly involved with Mental Health.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Implement online appointment scheduling and follow up on appointments through email.</li>
				<li>Complete follow up on the Committee of Leave of Absence and Withdrawal recommendations to ensure they adequately address student demands including being given more time to move out, having more advance notice that they have been readmitted, and while taking leave of absence, have access to university resources like career services and libraries.</li>
				<li>Development of mental health brochures clearly detailing mental health policies and what treatment and counseling will look like.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Miscellaneous University Services Ideas</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Get double ply toilet paper in the bathrooms.</li>
				<li>Work with office of disabilities to conduct a report to on campus accessibility for those who have a handicap.</li> 
				<li>Advocate for extended library hours on weekends, especially during finals period.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2 class="platform-point">3. Council Affairs</h2>
		<div class="platform-section">
			<ul>
				<li>Communication with College Council Presidents to solicit input on projects from college councils, implement projects with a college focus, and maintain a YCC presence in the colleges.</ul<>
				<li>Communication with Class Councils to obtain knowledge of class specific issues to carry out projects.</li>
				<li>Council Unity: As Vice President, a large part of my role would be maintaining and managing YCC’s internal relations. I would be the run leading meetings and working closely with policy directors to assign projects. Thus, it is important to ensure that the council is unified and has a good working relationship in order to carry out our objectives.</li>
				<li>Increase Visibility of representatives in colleges. I would work closely with the communications director to ensure a vision of a YCC that is accessible and vocal about students concerns is made a reality. To do this, I would like to see representatives play more of an active role in their residential colleges.</li>
				<li>Develop an online form for project ideas. I currently feel that students feel hesistant to submit project ideas to YCC because it seems faceless. I would like to develop an online forum on the website for submitting ideas and then would immediately follow these up with emails from a representative to meet with that person. This would also have an anonymous option for submitting ideas.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2 class="platform-point">4. Academics</h2>
		<div class="platform-section">
			<p>Our academic experiences are central to our time at Yale. With the expansion of Yale College and growing student interest in new fields, it is essential that academics adapt to fit student needs. Thus, academic resources and accessibility are a pivotal part of my vision for YCC.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Seminar Accessibility and Sophomore Seminars: As a sophomore, one of my biggest disappointments during shopping period was my inability to get into seminars. This is a frustrating experience for many sophomores who often feel like their academics are overlooked. Thus, I would like to investigate the potential for increasing seminars open to all years and/ or adding seminars that are only open to sophomores.</li>
				<li>Create an Asian American Studies major.</li>
				<li>Increase availability and breadth of courses in distributional requirements. We often hear talk about Issues Approach to Biology or Structure of Networks being completely over attended. This reveals there is a lack of courses that will satisfy the distributional requirements yet be manageable for students not majoring in that topic.</li> 
				<li>Look into potential for creation of half credit courses. At Yale, we are encouraged to explore as much as we can. Half credit courses would allow students to study more topics but not commit to the workload that comes along with a full credit course.</li>
				<li>Create full credit lab courses. Science majors often feel like lab is another course. Yet, they only receive half a credit for all their hard work. This project would look into the opportunity for lab courses to count for more credit.</li>
				<li>Establish student focus groups on residential expansion and need for more classes and faculty. As Yale College expands, already underfunded and under resourced departments will experience a greater demand for classes. Thus, it is necessary that as Yale expands, students have a voice and can give input on their needs.</li>
				<li>Create Big and Little Sibling program in the majors. There is excellent faculty advising. However, I sometimes feel I lack a student perspective when it comes to choosing majors. Thus, this project would pair underclassmen in the major with older students who can give more informal advice and class recommendations.</li> 
				<li>Create midterm ta evaluation. This year, YCC ensured that there would be a way to give professors a midterm evaluation via ClassesV2. A similar evaluation should be established for TAs so that they can hear student feedback and address it throughout the semester.</li>
			</ul>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="experience-content">

	<h2>2014-2015</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>University Services Director of YCC Executive Board</li>
		<li>YCC Liaison to Mental Health Steering Committee, Member of Mental Health Coalition, Member of Mental Health and Counseling Student Advisory Committee</li>
		<li>Meets regularly with Yale Dining</li>
		<li>Member of YCC Events Committee</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2013-2014</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Calhoun Representative to Yale College Council</li>
		<li>Associate Representative to Freshman Class Council</li>
		<li>Member of Undergraduate Student Advisory Board on Alcohol</li>
		<li>Member of YCC Events Committee</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All these experiences have been crucial in shaping my YCC experience. Yet, these experiences would mean little if I didn’t use them to try to create meaningful change. As Calhoun representative last year, I completed projects including a review of the Freshmen alcohol course and a calculator exchange program. In FCC, I helped plan events such as Freshman Screw and the Freshman Olympics. This year, I have worked on a wide range of projects including getting phone chargers in Bass (PSA: they’re finally in Bass and ready to use!), reforming the accessibility of special services vans, and improving the condition of the intramural sports fields.</p>
	<p>I have been active in promoting the accessibility of resources to the student body. This past month I organized a series of wellness workshops for students and I am currently in the process of organizing a summer storage program. Additionally, through meeting regularly with dining and mental health administrators, I have had a chance to develop working relationships and have meaningful conversations on these issues. I will bring these experiences to the role of Vice President and look forward to learning even more!</p>
